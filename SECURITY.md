## 🔐 Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

This boilerplate includes several security-focused features:

#### Development Security

- **TypeScript strict mode** - Prevents common type-related vulnerabilities
- **ESLint security rules** - Catches potential security issues during development
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** - Automated checks for known vulnerabilities
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Prevents insecure code from being committed

#### Build Security

- **Content Security Policy** headers in production builds
- **Secure asset handling** - Proper resource loading and validation
- **Bundle analysis** - Identifies potentially malicious or vulnerable code
- **Source map security** - Configurable source map exposure

#### Runtime Security

- **XSS protection** - Vue.js built-in XSS prevention
- **CSRF protection** - Guidelines for implementing CSRF tokens
- **Secure headers** - Recommended security headers configuration
- **Input validation** - Examples of proper input sanitization

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] **Update all dependencies** to latest secure versions
- [ ] **Run security audit** (`npm audit --audit-level moderate`)
- [ ] **Configure security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS** for all environments
- [ ] **Review environment variables** for sensitive data exposure
- [ ] **Implement proper authentication** if required
- [ ] **Set up monitoring** for security events
- [ ] **Configure error handling** to avoid information disclosure

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] **Monthly dependency updates** and security audits
- [ ] **Quarterly security review** of custom code
- [ ] **Monitor security advisories** for Vue.js and dependencies
- [ ] **Review access logs** for suspicious activity
- [ ] **Update security documentation** as needed

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Development Environment

- **MCP Servers** - The included MCP servers (Context7, Chrome DevTools, Modus Docs) are development tools and should not be exposed in production
- **Development Rules** - The `.cursor/rules/` directory contains development guidelines and should not be deployed to production
- **Debug Information** - Ensure debug mode is disabled in production builds

### Third-Party Dependencies

- **Modus Web Components** - Loaded from CDN; ensure integrity checks are in place
- **Icon Fonts** - Loaded from external CDN; consider self-hosting for critical applications
- **Vue.js** - Keep updated to latest stable version for security patches

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers Only** - This boilerplate targets modern browsers with native web component support
- **Polyfills** - If supporting older browsers, ensure polyfills are from trusted sources
- **Feature Detection** - Implement proper feature detection for security-sensitive features
